### Assignment

The goal of this excercise was to create a PDF downloader for a customer.
The links the the urls were given in a large Excel document, from which the costumer also wanted alternate links to be used, in case the primary link didn't work.

NOTE:
The required Excel document this program is built for is not part of the reposetory.

WARNING:
The program will create sub folders in the selected folder and can potentially download a large amount of data, if not set up correctly.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements in 'requirements.txt'
3. Configure the 'Config' class in 'main.py'
3.1. Use comments to select different types of url_handlers and filters
4. Run 'main.py'
5. When the program asks for a file, select the Excel file this program was built for.
6. Browse the log files created
